# Mentor Léo - Learn by doing: https://mentorleo.co
This repository is meant to regroup all the code produced by the Léos during their projects.
Everyone can see the code of anybody, learn from it and help.

## Who the hell are we ?

Visit https://mentorleo.co to learn about us.

In short, we believe in **Learn by doing**. Mentors connect with developpers (beginners or confirmed), and help them through doing challenging projects.

## Contributing
1. Every project will have its own folder in `/projects`. Each project can be subdivised into parts.
For example the portfolio project is divided in 3 parts, you can see the first part by going to `/projects/portfolio/week1`

2. Inside each project, the Léos must include their work into a folder identified by their slack nickname. For example `/projects/portfolio/week1/damien`

3. You must create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to integrate your work into the project. You have the choice in the name of the branch, but prefixing it with your slack nickname and the project name is a good idea, like `damien-week-1-day3`

4. Ping your mentor in the pull request description. Be careful, slack nicknames and github nicknames are different ! For the portfolio project, ping me `@Ormancer`. For another project, ping the right mentor.

5. You are encouraged to look at the other pull requests. You'll learn a lot by reading code, and you will be able to help the others as well :rocket:
